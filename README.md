# CRDF
Crowdfunding is one of the popular ways to raise funds for a project, cause or help any individual in need. This project aims at doing so by providing the stakeholders with the platform which is powered by blockchain and Ethereum using Smart Contracts. The prime motive to develop this platform is to provide support to the needy.
The MetaMask technology used here contributes to the anonymity for the Donor. 
This MetaMask directly connects to the Ethereum account and the coins can be easily used to donate and withdraw.
The webpage is designed using ReactJS components. These components are connected to the MetaMask-Ethereum through Blockchain.
Web3 JS libraries are used to implement the Blockchain and Ethereum in the offline mode.
The  Campaign created can be aborted at any point of time even during the time of progress of the project if both parties agree.
The objective of this project is to create a web 3.0 crowdfunding platform that enables artists and creators to raise funds for their creative projects. 
The platform will be based on blockchain technology, and will leverage the benefits of smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and digital tokens to provide a transparent, secure, and accessible way for artists to connect with their fans and supporters.
